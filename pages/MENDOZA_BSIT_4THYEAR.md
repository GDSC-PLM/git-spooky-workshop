##  My Insights from Git Spooky: Conjuring Code for Hacktoberfest Study Jam

I learned that GIT is an open source version control system that will assist developers work together on building web or software projects.

Based on the presentation about GIT syntaxes and a cheatsheet provided by the GDSC, I find them challenging. As a beginner, in order for me to practice, I searched through the internet and watched some youtube videos on how to use those GIT syntaxes. After that, I will put my learnings into a practice or a test.

After practicing the GIT syntaxes provided by the GDSC CTO and from the cheatstheet provided, I learned on how to use GIT for intializing, staging, commiting, branching, collaborating and sharing, and showing changes in my local Command Prompt.
